# Base Theme (master)

---

This theme is designed as a simple blog. The idea for this branch (master) of the theme is to keep it as simple as possible, in order to provide a starting point for other Wordpress projects. This theme is made to work with the Gutenberg editor. This theme includes: a header with logo & main/mobile menu locations, a footer with static copyright, a default singular template & a custom template for pages & posts that removes the header for full page-building. This theme allows for all default wordpress archivbes like blog, date, category etc. This theme DOESNT include post-comment functionality at the moment, but will look to incoorporate this later, possibly as a new branch to be merged.
