# Base Theme (new master)

---

This theme is designed for single pages, posts & other singular items ONLY. It is not designed to display Wordpress archives like a blog, category-archives or anything else. The idea is to keep this branch of the theme as simple as possible, in order to provide a starting point for other projects. This theme is made to work with the Gutenberg editor. This theme includes: a header with logo & main/mobile menu locations, a footer with static copyright, a default singular template & custom a template for pages & posts that removes the header for full page-building.
